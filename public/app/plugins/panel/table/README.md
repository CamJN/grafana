# Table Panel - Extended

This plugin is based on the native table plugin for grafana, but extends
it with new features.

## New Features

- Allow creation of a custom 2D table where the data in each cell comes from
  an arbitrary query (in development)

## Original Table Plugin Readme Text

The Table Panel is **included** with Grafana.

The table panel is very flexible, supporting both multiple modes for time series as well as for table, annotation and raw JSON data. It also provides date formatting and value formatting and coloring options.
